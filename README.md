## Simple ID3 Algorithm Implementation

By popular request of students at University of Economics in Silesia, Poland, I am pasting here my own simple program that builds ID3 tree. Application has been stripped of all the fancy stuff and condensed into single file (as requested). If you need something more complicated that meets your specific needs, you can always contact me, though be aware that I don't condone laziness anymore.
